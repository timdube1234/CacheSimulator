Description

The Cache Simulator is a command-line tool developed in C for simulating the behavior of cache memory. It processes input parameters to simulate caches of different configurations and calculates the number of cache hits and misses for given inputs. The program supports different replacement policies and provides detailed metrics, including miss rates and total cycles.

Features

Simulate cache behavior with configurable parameters: number of sets, lines per set, block size, and memory size.
Support for LFU and LRU cache replacement policies.
Calculation of cache hits, misses, total cycles, and miss rate.
Detailed output for each memory address processed, indicating a hit or a miss.

How to Use

Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
Run the executable in a terminal or command prompt.
Enter the cache configuration parameters as prompted.
Provide a series of memory addresses to process.
Analyze the output for cache performance metrics.
